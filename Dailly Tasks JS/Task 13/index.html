            Varanasi is one of the oldest living cities in the world. Its
            Prominence in Hindu mythology is virtually unrevealed. Mark Twain,
            the English author and literature, who was enthralled by the legend
            and sanctity of Benaras, once wrote, "Benaras is older than history,
            older than tradition, older even than legend and looks twice as old
            as all of them put together".

            October to March is the best time to visit Varanasi because most of
            the fairs here are held during this time of the year. Festivities
            begin with Diwali and continue to Dev Diwali celebrated on the 15th
            day from Diwali. In between, there is also Annakut. During this
            time, the ghats are lit with lights and diyas. Earthen lamps adorn
            the staircase of the ghats.

            When visiting Varanasi, one comes across plenty of ghats, but among
            them, Dashashwamedh Ghat is said to be one of the oldest and most
            important. This ghat, leading to the Ganges, is located close to the
            famous old Vishwanath temple in Kashi (today's Banaras). Another
            famous attraction is River Ganges which is the holiest river by the
            Hindus and many more.
